# Installation

## Stable release

To install P-spline PSD, run this command in your
terminal:

``` console
$ pip install pspline_psd
```

This is the preferred method to install P-spline PSD, as it will always install the most recent stable release.

If you don't have [pip][] installed, this [Python installation guide][]
can guide you through the process.

## From source

The source for P-spline PSD can be downloaded from
the [Github repo][https://github.com/avivajpeyi/psline_psd].

You can either clone the public repository:

``` console
$ git clone git://github.com/avivajpeyi/pspline_psd
```

Or download the [tarball][]:

``` console
$ curl -OJL https://github.com/avivajpeyi/pspline_psd/tarball/master
```

Once you have a copy of the source, you can install it with:

``` console
$ pip install .
```
